    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
        <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you
            must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of
            options
            you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final
            state.
            If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.
        </p>
        <p> Conceptually,you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves,
            though it may be
            that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the
            root,
            you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
        </p>
        <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most
            recent choice, and
            trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you
            here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good
            leaves to be found.
        </p>

        <p>This needs an example.</p>

            </li>

    <table cellpadding="20px">
        <tr>
            <td bgcolor="#F8F8F8">Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to
                understanding the algorithm. If solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node
                n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n)
                is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</td>

    <p><b>How does this work?</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is
        test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this
        is done by the lines
    </p>

    <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if
        the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by
        the lines

    <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating
        it is as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>To search a tree:</h2>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have <br>
                searched them all unsuccessfully.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h2>
    <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack
        algorithm. In fact, that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.
    </p>

    <table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0px">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <pre>
                    <font color="#007EB4" size="5px">
                        boolean solve(Node n) { 
                            put node n on the stack; 
                            while the stack is not empty { 
                                if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf { 
                                    if it is a goal node, return true 
                                    else pop it off the stack 
                                } 
                                else { 
                                    if the node at the top of the stack has untried children 
                                        push the next untried child onto the stack 
                                    else pop the node off the stack 
                                } 
                                return false 
                            }
                    </font>
                </pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table><br>

    <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently
        on the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all
        times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have
        no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there
        must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.
    </p>
    <p>When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the
        root to a goal node.</p>
    <p>Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in
        the
        sequence of recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by
        (for instance) printing the node at the current level, or storing it in an array.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the
        successful path:

                                if the leaf is a goal node { 
                                    print n

    <h2>Keep backtracking simple.</h2>

    <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they
        can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:</p>
    <p>for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate
        and
        stalemate solutions</p>
    <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a
        chess game, for example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a <strong>gameOver method</strong>
        (or you could even
        call it <strong>isLeaf).</strong> This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any
        possible moves
        remain. </p>
    <p>Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path,
        which of its children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made
        this look simple, by just saying <strong>for each child c of n.</strong> In reality, it may be difficult to
        figure out what the
        possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node can
        represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement
        after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones
        you've already examined? </p>
    <p>The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been
        tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list
        of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remaining
        untried children, and you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of
        additional work. </p>
    <p>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an
        ordering on the children. If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine
        which child to try next. </p>
    <p>For example, you might be able to number the <strong>children 1 through n,</strong> and try them in
        numerical order. Then, if you have just tried <strong>child k,</strong> you know that you have already tried
        children 1 through
        <strong>k-1,</strong> and you have not yet tried children <strong>k+1</strong> through <strong>n.</strong> Or,
        if you are trying to color a map with just four
        colors, you can always try <strong>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</strong> If child yellow
        fails, you know to try
        child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right
        <strong>(or
            perhaps north, east, south, west).</strong>
    </p>
    <p>It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. <strong>In
            the chess game example,</strong> you might number your pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try
        them in
        numerical order; but in addition each piece may also have several moves, and these must also be ordered. You can
        probably find some way to order the children of a node. If the ordering scheme is simple enough, you should use
        it; but if it is too cumbersome, you are better off keeping a list of untried children.</p>

    <h2>Example: Tree Search</h2>
    <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will
        also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.
    <p>A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can
        reference (point to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to
        as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and
        there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say
        that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which
        we repeat here) shows a binary tree.</p>
    <p>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</p>

    <table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0px">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <pre>
                    <font color="#007EB4" size="5px">
                        public class BinaryTree { 
                            BinaryTree leftChild = null; 
                            BinaryTree rightChild = null; 
                            boolean isGoalNode = false; 
                            String name; 
                            
                            BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) { 
                                this.name = name; 
                                leftChild = left; 
                                rightChild = right; 
                                this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode; 
                            } 
                        }
                    </font>
                </pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above
        binary tree.

    <h2>What are the children?</h2>

    <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all
        the previous choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as
        you know, both the left and the right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able
        to eliminate children immediately, without recursion.</p>
    <p>Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map.
        It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter how convoluted the countries are, can be
        colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the same color. </p>
    <p>To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until
        all
        countries are colored. </p>
    <p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether
                you are at a goal node.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If
                and when you run out of countries, you have successfully colored the map.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable;
        after all, a checkerboard only needs two colors.
    </p><br>

    <p><b>boolean mapIsOK()</b> <br>
        Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.</p>
    <p><b>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</b> <br>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether
        there is an adjacent
        node already colored with the given color.</p>
    <p><b>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column) </b><br>Used by both methods to
        find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard).
    </p><br>

    <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
    <table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0px">
        <tr>

                        boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) { 
                            if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return mapIsOK(); 
                            map[row][column] = color; 
                            for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) { 
                                int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column); 
                                if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true; 
                            } 
                            return false; 
                        }

            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>And here's the code for method 2:</p>
    <table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0px">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <pre>

                        boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) { 
                            if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return true; 
                            if (okToColor(row, column, color)) { 
                                map[row][column] = color; 
                                for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) { 
                                    int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column); 
                                    if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true; 
                                } 
                            } 
                            return false; 
                        }
                    </font>
                </pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests
        otherwise:</p>

    <table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="3px">
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td bgcolor="lightgray">2 by 3 map</td>
            <td bgcolor="lightgray">3 by 3 map</td>
            <td bgcolor="lightgray">3 by 4 map</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td bgcolor="lightgray">Method 1: </td>
            <td>60 ms.</td>
            <td>940 ms.</td>
            <td>60530 ms. (1 minute)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td bgcolor="lightgray">Method 2: </td>
            <td>0 ms.</td>
            <td>0 ms.</td>
            <td>0 ms.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge
        difference? Either of these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates
        all of its descendents, and this will often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a
        leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children
        (reduce the set of choices), do so!

    <h2>Debugging Techniques</h2>
    <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we
        need to fall back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print
        statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug
        recursive routines.
    </p><br>

    <p><b>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</b></p>
    <p>Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important
        ones). You probably want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves
        with. However, if you just print a long list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their
        corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.
    </p><br>

    <p><b>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging. </b></p>
    <p>Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes
        can itself contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.
    </p>

    <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in
        larger programs the proportions will be better.
    </p>

    <table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0px">
        <tr>

                            if (node == null) return null; 
                            else return node.name;

    <p>To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>

        <tr>
            <td>
                <pre>

                            if (node == null) return no(node); 
                            if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node); 
                            if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node); 
                            if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node);

        true
    </ul><br>

    <p><b>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</b></p>
    <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it
        is to debug the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?
    </p>
    <p>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or
        to turn over to your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's
        more, in the above example, you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every
        return(no(node)) with return false. With all these changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.
    </p>
    <p>The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p>

    <p>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too
        much about making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it
        can never be true, and the controlled code will be discarded.

    <p><b>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</b></p>
    <p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message
        printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own
        Exceptions. However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it.
        For example, the following code
    </p>

    <table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0px">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <pre>
                    <font color="#007EB4" size="5px">
                        new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);
                    </font>
                </pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above
        code just acts like a print statement.

    <h2>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</h2>
    <p>I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marbles and
        the same number of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces to
        put the marbles in. Start with the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the
        other end, and a free space in between.
    </p>

    <table border="1px" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7px" align="center">
        <tr>
            <td><img src="/black-ball/black-ball.png" alt="blackball"></td>
            <td><img src="/black-ball/black-ball.png" alt="blackball"></td>
            <td width="48px"></td>
            <td><img src="./white-ball/white-ball.png" alt="whiteball"></td>
            <td><img src="./white-ball/white-ball.png" alt="whiteball"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The goal is to reverse the positions of the marbles:</p>

    <table border="1px" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7px" align="center">
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./white-ball/white-ball.png" alt="whiteball"></td>
            <td><img src="./white-ball/white-ball.png" alt="whiteball"></td>
            <td width="48px"></td>
            <td><img src="/black-ball/black-ball.png" alt="blackball"></td>
            <td><img src="/black-ball/black-ball.png" alt="blackball"></td>
        </tr>
    </table><br><br>
    <p><b>The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up).
            At each move, a marble can either:</b>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>ump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>For example, you could make the following sequence of moves:</p>

    <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we
        are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.
    </p>
    <p>Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to
        attempt to solve the puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it
        will fail, and the main program will have to print out the bad news. </p>
    <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we
        are at a leaf, which in this case means a
        position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy. </p>
    <p>Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the
        current board position. Hence to find the
        children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. Remember
        that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves. </p>
    <p>Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a
        number of approaches would work,
        and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find a
        different but equally valid approach. </p>
    <p>First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can
        move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that,
        to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have
        looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table to keep
        track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board
        each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive. </p>
    <p>Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking
        about moving a particular marble,
        we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that
        must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique.
        There is a slight complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the
        marbles) stay in one place.
    </p><br>

    <p><b>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the
            board. For each space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean
            method canMove(int[] board, int position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given
            position:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
    </ul><br>

    <p>We write another method <b>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b> that will take a board and a
        position, make
        a move from that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently
        by changing the old board, rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In
        technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" rather than "mutative."
    </p>
    <p>Along with <b>canMove and makeMove,</b> we are using methods <b>puzzleSolved and printBoard</b> with meanings
        that should be
        obvious. With these methods, our central backtracking method can be written as follows:
